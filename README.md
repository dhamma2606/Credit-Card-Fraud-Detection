**Credit Card Fraud Detection**

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques on a real-world, highly imbalanced dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains anonymized transaction records with numerical features generated using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), along with transaction amount and time information. The workflow includes data exploration, preprocessing, handling class imbalance using SMOTE, and feature analysis to understand fraud patterns. Multiple machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest were trained and evaluated using metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC to reduce false negatives and improve fraud detection accuracy. The project demonstrates an end-to-end implementation of a scalable and data-driven fraud detection system.
